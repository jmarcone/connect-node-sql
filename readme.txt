ðŸ’» Connect your NodeJS application to PostgreSQL
Brace up! We are going to create a small RESTful API using Node + Express + a PostgreSQL database that will serve the client with some data about users and their orders.

Work with Git: 1 First Commit + 1 Commit per addition of a request endpoint

Create a Github Repo for this exercise
Create an  instance on ElephantSQL (you have a guide for that)  
Create the database with: 

CREATE TABLE users (

   id  SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

   first_name varchar(255),

   last_name varchar(255),

   age int, 

  active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true

);


CREATE TABLE orders (

   id  SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

   price float,

   date timestamp,

   user_id int,

   FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)

);


INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, age) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 18);

INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, age) VALUES ('Bob', 'Dylan', 30);

INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, age) VALUES ('Jane', 'Doe', 25);

INSERT INTO orders (price,date, user_id) VALUES ( 18, '2021-01-01 00:00:00', 1);

INSERT INTO orders (price,date, user_id) VALUES ( 18, '2021-01-02 04:00:00', 1);

INSERT INTO orders (price,date, user_id) VALUES ( 18, '2021-01-03 05:00:00', 2);

INSERT INTO orders (price,date, user_id) VALUES ( 18, '2021-01-04 06:00:00', 2);
 

Create an Express server with separate routes for:
The users:
GET  /  : To get all the users 
GET  /:id :  To get one user (with the id) 
POST / -> To create a new user 
PUT /:id  :  To edit one user (with the id) 
DELETE  /:id : To delete one user (with the id)
The orders:
GET  /  : To get all the orders 
GET  /:id :  To get one order (with the id) 
POST / -> To create a new order
PUT /:id  :  To edit one order (with the id) 
DELETE  /:id : To delete one order (with the id) 
EXTRA (AKA; you can give it a go, but you donâ€™t have toâ€¦) If you are finished with these, try to:
Validate all the data coming from the users/orders for the Post/Put routes (help)
 Create a separate module for your pool object (help)
Create a user route that will return all the orders of a user
GET /:id/orders : To get all orders linked to a specific user
Create another user route that will set a user as inactive if he has never ordered anything:
PUT /:id/check-inactive : If a user has never ordered, he should be set as inactive
 Separate routes in 2 router files. One for Users, one for Orders: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html
